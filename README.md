# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Sequential polarization and imprinting of type 1 T helper lymphocytes by interferon-gamma and interleukin-12.**   
Schulz EG, Mariani L, Radbruch A, Höfer T. _Immunity._ 2009;30(5):666-8.

**Abstract:**   
Differentiation of naive T lymphocytes into type I T helper (Th1) cells
requires interferon-gamma and interleukin-12. It is puzzling that interferon-
gamma induces the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, whereas interleukin-12
mediates Th1 cell lineage differentiation. We use mathematical modeling to
analyze the expression kinetics of T-bet, interferon-gamma, and the IL-12
receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) during Th1 cell differentiation, in the
presence or absence of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma signaling. We show
that interferon-gamma induced initial T-bet expression, whereas IL-12Rbeta2
was repressed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The termination of TCR
signaling permitted upregulation of IL-12Rbeta2 by T-bet and interleukin-12
signaling that maintained T-bet expression. This late expression of T-bet,
accompanied by the upregulation of the transcription factors Runx3 and Hlx,
was required to imprint the Th cell for interferon-gamma re-expression. Thus
initial polarization and subsequent imprinting of Th1 cells are mediated by
interlinked, sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-interferon-
gamma-Stat1-T-bet and interleukin-12-Stat4-T-bet signaling.
